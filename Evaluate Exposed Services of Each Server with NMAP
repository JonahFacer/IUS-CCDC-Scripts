Mangement Team,

  Our team has performed a port scan of the external connection to our network. Here is our report of what we have found.

  Port 80/tcp, 22/tcp, 21/tcp, 111/tcp, and 53/tcp are open. The 21/tcp port is ftp this needs to be open for file tranfers.
Port 22/tcp is also open. It is ssh and needs to be left open for incoming conections.
Port 53/tcp is also open this is the domain. 80/tcp is open for http this also is needed for connections. The last open port is 111/tcp this is open for rpcbind.

  Our team also found 995 closed ports that need to remain closed. Keeping these services closed will allow us to stay secure and mitigate exposures of our server.

  We have also attached a sceenshot of our examination.

Thank you,
Team 14
